            <summary>
            A bank identification number (BIN) is the initial four to six numbers that appear on a
            card. The bank identification number uniquely identifies the institution issuing the
            card. The BIN is key in the process of matching transactions to the issuer of the
            card. This numbering system applies to charge cards, gift cards, debit cards, prepaid
            cards, and electronic benefit cards.
